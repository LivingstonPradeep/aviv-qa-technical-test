# AVIV Automated tests

## Playwright e2e Tests

### Overview

Playwright e2e Test Automation Framework for AVIV is a **TypeScript-based Hybrid framework** designed to ensure the quality and functionality of the API and UI. It follows best practices for test automation, including the Page Object Model (POM) and data-driven testing, and provides robust test coverage for critical application workflows.

### Features

- **Hybrid Framework**: Supports both UI and API test execution.
- **Action Layer**: Implements an abstraction layer to improve test reusability and maintainability.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Uses YAML files for flexible and structured test data management.
- **Test Execution and Reporting**:
  - Integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD execution.
  - Allure Reporting for enhanced test insights.
  - Screenshots and videos captured for test validation and debugging.
- **Flexible Test Data Structure**: Allows for easy modifications to test data without altering test logic.

### Test Automation Best Practices

#### Page Object Model (POM)

- Implements the Page Object Pattern to create an object repository for web UI elements.
- Each page has a corresponding class for improved modularity.
- Maintains a clear separation between test methods and page-specific code.
- Groups related elements and actions within relevant page objects for easier maintenance.
- **UI operations should be written as Page classes, while API actions should be written as their API class counterparts.** The Actions class will decide which operation to choose based on the mode specified in the test data.

#### Data-Driven Testing

- Externalized test data is stored in YAML files for scalability and ease of maintenance.
- There is no restriction to where the test data files are placed but its recommended to be placed inside `tests/playwright/test-data/` directory.
- Tests are parameterized to run with multiple data sets.
- Maintains a clear separation between test data and test logic.
- Includes both positive and negative test scenarios to ensure robustness.
- Test data can be structured in any format as long as it is correctly handled in the test.

##### Example YAML Test Data File:
```yaml
tests:
- description: "UI-Login-User"
  username: "test@example.com"
  password: "Test123!"
  role: "user"
  mode: "ui"
  negative: false

- description: "UI-Register-Agent-Fail"
  fullName: "Harrison Ford"
  email: "patty@example.com"
  password: "Test"
  role: "agent"
  mode: "ui"
  phone: "1234"
  negative: true
  errorMessages: ["Please enter a valid phone number", "Password must be at least 8 characters"]
```

Negative test scenarios are expected to throw exceptions. The test execution will verify if the expected error messages are present in the application response.

#### Action Layer
- The Action Layer implements an abstraction layer to improve test reusability and maintainability.
- The Action Layer can also be used to implement polymorphism by accomplishing the task by either UI or API based on the input
- Action Layer helps keep the test simple and clean
Note: The API actions are not implemented/covered yet.

##### Reading and Using Test Data in Tests:
```typescript
const propertyPageSearchTestData = propertiesTestData.tests.filter(obj => obj.description.includes("UI-Property-Page-Search"));

propertyPageSearchTestData.forEach((testData) => {
  test(testData.description, async ({ page, request }) => {
    try {
      const usersAction = new UsersAction(page, request, testData.mode, testData.role);
      await usersAction.performTest();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  });
});
```

### Test Scenarios Implemented

- **User Management**:
  - User registration, login, and logout test cases.
  - Verification of user roles and permissions (Admin, Agent, User).
  - User profile management functionality.
- **Property Management**:
  - Property listing and search functionality.
  - Validation of property details and booking process.

### Running Tests

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (latest LTS version recommended).
- Playwright installed via npm:
```sh
npm install @playwright/test
```
- Dependencies installed via npm:
```sh
npm install
```

#### Configuring Test Execution

##### Grouping Tests

Use `test.describe()` to group related tests:
```typescript
test.describe("Smoke Tests", () => {
  test("Verify homepage loads", async ({ page }) => {
    try {
      const usersAction = new UsersAction(page, request, testData.mode, testData.role);
      await usersAction.performTest();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  });
});
```

##### Using Tags to Categorize Tests

Run grouped tests using tags for different environments. Use the describe section of test data to tag the tests

```yaml
  tests:
  - description: "@regression-@critical-UI-Login-User"
```
And then run them using the commands like the ones below

```sh
  npx playwright test --grep "@regression"
  npx playwright test --grep "@critical"
```


##### Running Tests in Multiple Browsers

Execute tests in different browsers by adding entries for each browser in the Projects section of `playwright.config.ts`.
For example, if I need to add Firefox support I would have to add 
```typescript
{
      name: 'Realestate_Demo_Firefox',
      use: { 
        ...devices['Desktop Firefox'],
        baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:5173/",
        headless: true,
        screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
        video: 'retain-on-failure',
      },
    }
```
Note: Playwright Firefox dependency must be installed for this to work `npx playwright install firefox`


##### Increasing Workers

Modify `workers` in `playwright.config.ts` to increase parallel execution:
```typescript
workers: 4,
```
Or set dynamically during execution:
```sh
npx playwright test --workers=4
```

#### Generating Reports

- Allure reports are generated automatically and can be viewed locally:

- Pre-requisite to run the allure commandline
```sh
    npm install -g allure-commandline
```
- Generate Allure results
```sh
    allure generate reports/allure-results --clean -o allure-report
```
- View generated results
```sh
    allure serve allure-report
```
This will automatically lead you to the reports page.

### Continuous Integration

- The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is designed to **first set up the target application** before running the UI tests.
- CI/CD pipelines execute tests on GitHub Actions.
- Before the tests are triggered the AVIV demo application will be setup and run
- Tests will get triggered automatically for every push or pull request into main repo
- Test execution is dynamic based on environment variables for manual triggers
- To run using manual trigger go to Github Actions -> Playwright Test (Workflow) -> Run workflow. 
- Use the below command for example to override the default Env variable value
```sh
npx playwright test --grep "@priority"
```
- Reports are deployed and stored as artifacts for analysis.
- To view the test (allure) results check out the github pages links (https://livingstonpradeep.github.io/aviv-qa-technical-test/#)


### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the Page Object Model for structuring UI tests.
- Keep test data separate from test scripts.
- Ensure new test cases contribute towards the required coverage threshold.
- Use meaningful test case names and assertions for clarity.
- Submit PRs with relevant test cases and ensure they pass before merging.

### Conclusion

This framework provides a scalable, maintainable, and flexible approach to test automation. By following best practices and leveraging Playwrightâ€™s capabilities, it ensures high-quality software delivery with efficient test execution and reporting mechanisms.
